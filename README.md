NEMO v3.4 DRAKKAR - OPA-LIM2-PISCES
Run by: N. Chang, Southern Ocean Carbon-Climate Observatory, CSIR, Cape Town, South Africa
Compute resources: Lengau cluster, NICIS Centre for High Performance Computing, Cape Town, South Africa.

Model code, inputs and design benefited from collaborations within the Marie-Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme, SOCCLi (The role of the Southern Ocean Carbon cycle under CLImate change, 2012-2016) with the modelling team at Laboratoire de Glaciologie et GÃ¨ophysique de l'Environnement (LGGE), Grenoble, particularly, A. ALbert, J.-M. Molines, J. Le Sommer.
